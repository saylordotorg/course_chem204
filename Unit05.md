**Unit 5: Amino Acids and Metabolism** <span id="5"></span> 
*Amino acids are biomolecules that contain an amine group and a
carboxylic acid group.  They also contain a side chain that varies
depending on the amino acid.  In α-amino acids, the amino group is on
the carbon next to the carboxyl group; α-amino acids are the building
blocks for protein synthesis.  Amino acids also play vital roles
in coenzymes.  In some living organisms, including humans, not all amino
acids can be synthesized.  Essential amino acids are amino acids that
cannot be synthesized by an organism in sufficient amounts, because the
biosynthetic pathway is absent or not efficient enough.  Thus, essential
amino acids must come from the diet of the organism.    
              
 In this unit, you will learn about amino acid catabolism and
biosynthesis.  The first step of amino acid catabolism is the removal of
the amino group and the elimination of the toxic NH<sub>3 </sub>product
from the cell.  Next, the carbon chain of the amino acid is used in a
variety of biosynthetic pathways.  Note that it can also be used as an
energy source during starvation.  Amino acids are split into two major
groups depending on whether an organism can synthesize them or not.
 Non-essential amino acids can be synthesized by the cell in sufficient
amounts; essential amino acids cannot be synthesized and must come from
the diet.  In this unit, you will study the biosynthesis of amino acids
that are non-essential and those that are essential for humans.*
