**Unit 1: Common Mechanisms in Bioorganic Chemistry** <span
id="1"></span> 
*The reaction mechanism is the step-by-step sequence of events in a
chemical reaction.  It includes breaking chemical bonds,
producingtransition state intermediates, and making chemical bonds.  In
this unit, you will start with an overview of the functional groups of
organic molecules.  Next, you will study the mechanisms of nucleophilic
substitution, electrophilic addition, condensation, elimination, and
redox reactions.  The goal is to highlight the fact that these reactions
go forward only if the reactants meet specific structural
requirements.   
              
 Understanding the mechanisms of these reactions is necessary, because
they reveal how enzymes speed up similar reactions.  Knowledge of
reaction mechanisms also provides a basis for the design of
pharmaceutical compounds, which manipulate the yield of reactions, and
has implications in the treatment of metabolic diseases.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 25.75 hours to complete.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and study this entire
    webpage, starting at the beginning and continuing until the end of
    the disulfide group section.  This section summarizes the basic
    structural characteristics of the functional groups. Alcohols,
    aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, amines, mercaptans, and esters
    are the most commonly discussed bioorganic molecules in this course.
     While all sugars have hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups, some
    of them are aldehydes (reducing sugars) and others are ketones. 
    Amino acids have both amino and carboxylic functional groups;
    glycerol and fatty acids in fats and phospholipids, as well as the
    monomers of DNA and RNA, are joined with ester bonds.  The amino
    acid cysteine has a thiol group, which is essential for the
    stabilization of protein structures with disulfide bridges.
     Functional groups play an essential role in the active sites of
    enzymes as well (e.g.the thiol group in the active site of thiol
    proteases and asparagine in carboxypeptidase).

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, scroll down to “2.
    Claisen Condensation,” and study this particular section on this
    webpage.  Press the grey “Structural Analysis” button to highlight
    the nucleophilic donor and electrophilic acceptor in this reaction.
     Click on the “Reaction Mechanism” button to display the breaking
    and forming of chemical bonds.  Fatty acid synthesis by fatty acid
    synthase is an example of Claisen condensation.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above to access the
    assessment, and read the instructions at the top of the webpage.  On
    this webpage, you will find five examples of Claisen products.  The
    exercise asks you to identify the enolate donor and carbonyl
    acceptor of these products from a list.  Click on “Check Answers”
    after you match all products with their enolate donor and carbonyl
    acceptor.  The “View Answers” button lets you see the correct
    answers.    
        
     This assessment will take approximately 1 hour to complete.
