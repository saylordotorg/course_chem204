Course Syllabus for "CHEM204: Bioorganic Chemistry"
---------------------------------------------------

Bioorganic chemistry studies the chemistry of organic biomolecules.
 It is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field that combines organic
chemistry and biochemistry.  Please recall that organic chemistry
investigates all molecules that contain carbon and hydrogen, and
biochemistry focuses on the network of molecular pathways in the cell.
 Bioorganic chemistry employs organic chemistry to explain how enzymes
catalyze the reactions of metabolic pathways and why metabolites react
the way they do.  Bioorganic chemistry aims to expand organic-chemical
research on structures, synthesis, and kinetics in a biological
direction. This one-semester course will cover several advanced
chemistry topics and will discuss the chemistry behind biological
processes.  The course begins by introducing you to the mechanisms
behind the most common biological chemical reactions (Unit 1).  You will
then take a closer look at the metabolic processes of biomolecules.  You
will apply your knowledge of the structural features of organic
molecules to biomolecules (Unit 2).  The next four units will cover the
chemistry of metabolic processes in the cell: lipid metabolism (Unit 3),
carbohydrate metabolism (Unit 4), amino acid metabolism (Unit 5), and
nucleotide metabolism (Unit 6).  This course will also discuss the
medical significance of the relevant deficiencies of these pathways.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  

-   Identify and characterize lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids, and
    nucleic acids.
-   Recognize chiral organic molecules, and explain their biological
    significance.
-   Explain the process of electrophilic and nucleophilic reactions,
    redox reactions, and enzyme catalyzed reactions.
-   Define the role of coenzymes and allosteric regulators in enzyme
    catalyzed reactions.
-   Compare and link terpenoid and steroid biosynthesis.
-   Compare and contrast the biosynthesis and the break down of
    biomolecules in the cell.
-   Predict the products of substitution, elimination, condensation, and
    redox reactions.
-   Design enzyme catalyzed reactions that lead to high-energy compound
    products.
-   Explain why certain lipids and amino acids are essential while
    others are not.
-   Determine the significance of fermentation during anaerobic
    metabolism.
-   Explain why certain metabolic pathways are called “cycles.”
-   Explain what happens if a eukaryotic cell lacks oxalic acid,
    ribulose bisphosphate, or ornithine.
-   Compare and contrast the Citric Acid Cycle and the Calvin Cycle.

### Course Requirements

In order to take this course you must:  

√    Have access to a computer.

√    Have continuous broadband Internet access.

√    Have the ability/permission to install plug-ins or software (e.g.,
Adobe Reader or Flash).

√    Have the ability to download and save files and documents to a
computer.

√    Have the ability to open Microsoft files and documents (.doc,

√    Be competent in the English language.

√    Have read the [Saylor Student
Handbook.](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Saylor-StudentHandbook.pdf)  
  
 √   Have completed the following courses: [CHEM101: General Chemistry
I](http://www.saylor.org/courses/chem101/), [CHEM102: General Chemistry
II](http://www.saylor.org/courses/chem102/), [CHEM103: Organic Chemistry
I](http://www.saylor.org/courses/chem103/), and [CHEM104: Organic
Chemistry II](http://www.saylor.org/courses/chem104/)   

### Course Information

Welcome to CHEM204.  Below, please find general information on this
course and its requirements.   
    
 **Course Designer:** [Marianna Pintér,
PhD](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-o-t/#DrMariannaPinter); [Rachel
Lerebours, PhD](http://www.sayolor.org/#DrRachelLerebours)  
  
 **Primary Resources: ** This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   Dr. Joyce Diwan’s [Biochemistry of
    Metabolism](http://www.rpi.edu/dept/bcbp/molbiochem/MBWeb/mb1/MB1index.html)
-   Dr. Michael W. King’s [The Medical Biochemistry
    Page](http://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/)
-   Michigan State University: Dr. William Reusch’s *[Virtual Textbook
    of Organic
    Chemistry](http://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/VirtTxtJml/intro1.htm)*
-   Salman Khan’s [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Please pay special attention to Units 1 and 2, as these lay the
groundwork for understanding the more advanced, exploratory material
presented in the latter units.  You will also need to complete:  

-   Subunit 1.1 Assessments
-   Subunit 1.5.4 Assessment
-   Subunit 2.1.1 Assessment
-   Subunit 2.1.2 Assessment
-   Subunit 2.2.1 Assessment
-   Subunit 2.4.1 Assessment
-   Subunit 2.4.2 Assessment
-   Subunit 2.5.1 Assessment
-   Subunit 2.5.2 Assessment
-   Subunit 2.6.1 Assessment
-   Subunit 2.6.3 Assessment
-   The Final Exam

Please note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final
Exam.  However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will
need to work through the problem sets within the above-listed
assessments.  
    
 In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of
approximately **142.5 hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time
advisory” that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on
each subunit.  It may be useful to take a look at these time advisories
and determine how much time you have over the next few weeks to complete
each unit and to then set goals for yourself.  For example, Unit 1
should take you approximately 25.75 hours to complete.  Perhaps you can
sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1
(estimated at 4.5 hours) on Monday night; subunit 1.2 (estimated at 3.75
hours) on Tuesday night; subunits 1.3 and 1.4 (estimated at 3 hours) on
Wednesday night; etc.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** As noted in the “Course Requirements,” there are
prerequisites for this course.  It is essential to review [CHEM103:
Organic Chemistry I](http://www.saylor.org/courses/chem103/) and
[CHEM104: Organic Chemistry II](http://www.saylor.org/courses/chem104/)
before you begin this course.  If you find the discussion of the
clinical significance of metabolism fascinating in this course, you
might consider taking [BIO305:
Genetics](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio305/).
