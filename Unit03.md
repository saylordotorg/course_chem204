**Unit 3: Lipid Metabolism** <span id="3"></span> 
*The term “lipid” refers to a broad group of hydrophobic biomolecules. 
This family of compounds includes fats, waxes, steroids, fat-soluble
vitamins (such as vitamins A, D, E, and K), and phospholipids, just to
name a few.  While most lipids are hydrophobic, some are amphiphilic,
meaning that they possess a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail. 
This property enables them to form vesicles and membranes in aqueous
environments.  Hydrophobic chemicals can be dissolved into the
membrane.  The primary biological functions of lipids in living
organisms include plasma membrane building, energy storage, enzyme
regulation, and signaling.  This unit explains the biosynthesis and
biodegradation of lipids.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 21.5 hours to complete.
