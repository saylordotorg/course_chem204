**Unit 2: Biomolecules** <span id="2"></span> 
*Biomolecules are organic molecules synthesized in living organisms. 
All biomolecules are organic, meaning that they are primarily composed
of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.  Some biomolecules contain
other atoms as well (e.g.  phosphorus and/or sulfur).  Biomolecules vary
in size.  Some are large polymeric molecules, such as proteins,
polysaccharides, and nucleic acids, while others are small, such as
metabolites, lipids, and the monomers of the polymers.  
              
 In Organic Chemistry, you learned about organic compounds; this unit
will focus on carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and nucleic acids that
occur in the cell.  In Organic Chemistry, you also learned about
stereoisomerism; this unit will focus on stereoisomers that are produced
by the cell, including chiral molecules and cis-trans isomers.  You may
recall that some reactions involving organic compounds produce specific
stereoisomers.  The stereoselectivity of reactions in the cell is more
pronounced, because enzymes that catalyze biochemical reactions are
chiral themselves.  Only one enzyme enantiomer exists in the cell and
has biological activity.  Life on Earth is chiral.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 30.75 hours to complete.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and on a separate
    piece of paper,answer all of the quiz questions in the “Chiral or
    Optical Isomers” column of the table.  Then, click on the drop-down
    menu next to each question to check your answers.  Note that chiral
    compounds are also called “optical isomers” or “optically active”
    substances, because the isomers have the ability to rotate the plane
    of the polarized light.  Optical activity is measured with
    polarimeter, and some microscopes are equipped with polarimeter.

    that diastereomers include cis-trans isomers, non-enantiomeric
    chiral compounds, and epimers; epimers have more than one chiral
    center, but differ only in one chiral center (the others are
    identical); and meso compounds have an internal plane of symmetry.

     Instruction: Please click on the link above, and study the
    "Coenzymes" section on this page.  Note that coenzymes are essential
    for the activity of many enzymes.  Please note that you have already
    studied this webpage in Subunit 2.6.1, where you have focused on
    general characteristics of enzymes.  Enzymes are amino acid
    polymers.  In this Subunit, you learn about coenzymes, which are
    small organic molecules.  Coenzymes are essential for the biological
    activity of certain enzymes.  For example, nicotine adenine
    dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) is essential for the function of
    alcohol dehydrogenase, which has a detoxification role in our body
    after alcohol consumption.  Many enzymes catalyze biological
    reactions without needing a coenzyme, e.g. trypsin and chymotrypsin
    work without coenzyme; these enzymes catalyze protein hydrolysis in
    the small intestine.
