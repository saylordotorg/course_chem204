**Unit 4: Carbohydrate Metabolism** <span id="4"></span> 
*Carbohydrates have the general formula
C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>O<sub>n</sub>.  Autotrophs synthesize
carbohydrates (e.g. plants synthesize simple sugar from carbon dioxide
and water through photosynthesis).  The central simple carbohydrate is
glucose, because it is delivered as an energy source to all cell types
in most multicellular organisms.  Carbohydrates may be stored in
polysaccharide form (e.g. glycogen and starch, converted to energy or
used as building blocks in a variety of biosynthetic pathways).  Other
polysaccharides (e.g. chitin and cellulose) are structural and used for
cellular support.  This unit explains the major catabolic and anabolic
pathways of carbohydrate metabolism.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 25.5 hours to complete.
