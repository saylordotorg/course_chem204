**Unit 6: Nucleotide Metabolism** <span id="6"></span> 
*Nucleotides are building blocks of RNA and DNA.  They are also a part
of a number of high energy molecules, including ATP, which is the energy
currency in all known cells.  Nucleotides function as cofactors in the
regulation of enzyme activities.  A nucleotide is composed of
a nitrogenous base, a sugar, and phosphate groups.  In this unit, you
will study the biosynthesis and biodegradation of nucleotides. *

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 16.5 hours to complete.

    Biosynthesis” section, hover your mouse over the abbreviated names
    of the intermediates (PRA, GAR, FGAR, FGAM, AIR, CAIR, SAICAR,
    AICAR, and FAICAR) to see their chemical structures.  Note that the
    inosine monophosphate (IMP) is the primary nucleotide product of de
    novonucleotide synthesis.  IMP is built on a phosphorylated ribose
    derivative (PRPP).  Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and guanosine
    monophosphate (GMP) are derived from IMP in consecutive reactions of
